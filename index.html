                    Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, (born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died
                    January 30, 1948, Delhi), Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer who became the
                    leader
                    of the nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he came to be considered the
                    father of his country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest
                    (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress.First of all, Mahatma Gandhi was a notable
                    public figure. His role in social and political reform was instrumental. Above all, he rid the
                    society of these social evils. Hence, many oppressed people felt great relief because of his
                    efforts. Gandhi became a famous international figure because of these efforts. Furthermore, he
                    became the topic of discussion in many international media outlets.

                    Mahatma Gandhi made significant contributions to environmental sustainability. Most noteworthy, he
                    said that each person should consume according to his needs. The main question that he raised was
                    “How much should a person consume?”. Gandhi certainly put forward this question.
